Boomalang
----------

I've wanted to learn a few new languages for awhile, 
and I thought this new project would be a great place 
to showcase what I'm learning.

Throughout taking several classes on Coursera,
I started taking notes by writing scripts.  So, i'm using 
these as a starting point.

For a while I've been getting sick of referring to Google
every single time I forget the correct syntax, spelling, and
order of parameters.  So this is intended to be a personal reference.

As a programmer, it is important to solve problems ONCE and only once.
So this project is a great repository of information.  As I run into these
problems, I will document them here so I can refer to them later.  

Also, in each script, I may refer to blogs, tutorials, etc for code examples.  
I'm will try to credit these references as I use them.

Current Langs
=============
I'm current working on adding these languages to Boomalang.
- R (taking a few statistics classes on coursera)
- SML (for my Coursera Proglang class with Dan Grossman)
- eList (learning emacs and wanted to learn list for awhile)
- cpp (tired of not being able to say i know cpp)

Future Langs
============
These are languages that I'm excited about learning,
but don't yet have experience with.
- GOOOO!!!!!! (thx Zeus(Rails) for showing me that Go is as cool as Google says it is)
- Python
- Clojure (this looks a little more fun than scala)
- Matlab (cuz it's like math and stuff - fourier teh winz)

Other Langs
===========
These are languages that I have a little experience with,
and would like to document in Boomalang once I get the chance.
- Octave (passed the Coursera Machine Learning class)
- Scala (took part of a coursera class on Scala)

Complete Langs
==============
These are langs that are complete (or mostly complete anyways.
- n/a
