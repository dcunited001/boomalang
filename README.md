Boomalang
----------

Throughout taking several classes on Coursera,
I started taking notes by writing scripts.

For a while I've been getting sick of referring to Google
every single time I forget the correct syntax, spelling, and
order of parameters.

As a programmer, it is important to solve problems ONCE and only once.
So this project is a great repository of information.  As I run into these
problems, I will document them here so I can refer to them later.

I also want to learn a few new languages and I thought this new project
would be a great place to showcase what I'm learning.

Current Langs
=============
I'm current working on adding these languages to Boomalang.
- R (taking a few statistics classes on coursera)
- SML (for my Coursera Proglang class with Dan Grossman)
- eList (learning emacs and wanted to learn list for awhile)

Future Langs
============
These are languages that I'm excited about learning,
but don't yet have experience with.
- Python
- Clojure (this looks a little more fun than scala)
- Matlab (cuz it's like math and stuff - fourier teh winz)

Other Langs
===========
These are languages that I have a little experience with,
and would like to document in Boomalang once I get the chance.
- Octave (passed the Coursera Machine Learning class)
- Scala (took part of a coursera class on Scala)
